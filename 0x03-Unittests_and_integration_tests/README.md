Unit testing is the process of testing that a particular function returns expected results for different set of inputs. A unit test is supposed to test standard inputs and corner cases. A unit test should only test the logic defined inside the tested function. Most calls to additional functions should be mocked, especially if they make network or database calls.

The goal of a unit test is to answer the question: if everything defined outside this function works as expected, does this function work as expected?

Integration tests aim to test a code path end-to-end. In general, only low level functions that make external calls such as HTTP requests, file I/O, database I/O, etc. are mocked.

Integration tests will test interactions between every part of your code.

Execute your tests with
```bash
$ python -m unittest path/to/test_file.py
```

## Tasks
### [0. Parameterize a unit test]()

Familiarize yourself with the `utils.access_nested_map` function and understand its purpose. Play with it in the Python console to make sure you understand.

In this task you will write the first unit test for utils.`access_nested_map`.

Create a `TestAccessNestedMap` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.

Implement the `TestAccessNestedMap.test_access_nested_map` method to test that the method returns what it is supposed to.

Decorate the method with `@parameterized.expand` to test the function for following inputs:
```py
nested_map={"a": 1}, path=("a",)
nested_map={"a": {"b": 2}}, path=("a",)
nested_map={"a": {"b": 2}}, path=("a", "b")
```
For each of these inputs, test with `assertEqual` that the function returns the expected result.

The body of the test method should not be longer than 2 lines.
